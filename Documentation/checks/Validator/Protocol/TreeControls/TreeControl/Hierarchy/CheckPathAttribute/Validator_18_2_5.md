# CheckPathAttribute

## NonExistingIdsInAttribute\_Sub

### Details

The Hierarchy@path attribute should contain a comma separated list of table PIDs.  
Those tables will define the different levels of the TreeControl.  
Note that this can also be achieved with more flexibility via the Hierarchy\/Table tags.
