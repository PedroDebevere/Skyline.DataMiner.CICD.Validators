## ConditionCanBeSimplified

### Details

The 'QAction\/Condition' can be simplified. Some examples of when the condition can be simplified:  
  \- The condition contains redundant parentheses.  
  \- The condition does not contain a variable and therefore can either be dropped completely (or a variable must be included).
