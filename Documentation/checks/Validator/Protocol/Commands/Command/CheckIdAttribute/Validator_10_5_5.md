# CheckIdAttribute

## DuplicatedId

### Details

The id attribute is used internally as the identifier for each command.  
It is therefore mandatory and needs to follow a number of rules:  
\- Each command should have a unique id.  
\- Should be an unsigned integer.  
\- Only plain numbers are allowed (no leading signs, no leading zeros, no scientific notation, etc).
