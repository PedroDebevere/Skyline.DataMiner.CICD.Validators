# CheckDisplayKey

## FormatChanged

### Details

The display key of tables can be defined via 'ArrayOptions@option:naming' or via 'ArrayOptions\/NamingFormat'.  
'ArrayOptions\/NamingFormat' is the prefered way and going from one syntax to another has no breaking impact as long as the defined format is equivalent.
