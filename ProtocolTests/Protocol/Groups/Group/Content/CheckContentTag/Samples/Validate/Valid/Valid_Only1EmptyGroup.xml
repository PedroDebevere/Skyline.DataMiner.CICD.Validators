			<!--Workaround for a software issue:
				When a protocol has no group at all, we need to add a dummy empty one so that:
					- Some protocol threads get triggered/started.
					- Some threads get added to SLWatchdog.
				This also means than having such empty group only makes sense in 2 scenarios:
					- the group is a multi-threaded group.
					- the group is the only one in the protocol (doesn't make sense to have non multi-threaded and empty group if there are other groups in the protocol)-->
